If you're in NYC, come join us for a walking tour around the Gowanus Canal on July 10! This event is part of the wider [City of Water Day] (https://www.hudsonriver.org/article/city-of-water-day-2021) celebration. We'll walk along the extent of Hurricane Sandy's floodline and discuss the neighborhood's natural history, water management system, present and future flood risk, and proposed rezoning. All are welcome! More info [here] (https://www.gowanuscanal.org/gowanus-watermark-walk-1).
