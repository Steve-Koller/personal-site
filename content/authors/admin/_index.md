I'm an Environmental Science and Policy PhD student at the University of Miami's Abess Center for Ecosystem Science and Policy. I study flood risk and policy design for equitable and effective flood risk mitigation in a changing climate. My current work focuses on flood risk mitigation infrastructure and its impacts on affected communities; land use policy in the floodplain; housing density and National Flood Insurance Program outcomes; and tidal flooding impacts on low-wealth households. At the University of Miami, I am a member of the [Climate Risks and Preparedness](https://climateprep.rsmas.miami.edu/) and [Environmental and Resource Economics](https://ere.rsmas.miami.edu/index.html) labs.
